## 📖 Overview

A comprehensive investing primer for tech professionals. This repo offers a systematic, data-driven, fully reproducible learning kit focused on long-term value creation.

I have spent years building products and working with data in tech. I also paid real tuition learning to invest, read widely, and took many wrong turns. I distilled that experience into three priorities:

- Systematic learning. We learn fast but often lack a coherent practice path. The internet is fragmented and heavy on sentiment and “info flow.” Every clever tactic still rests on core finance and accounting. Without that foundation, copycat gains rarely stick and you end up glued to the screen.

- Data-driven and reproducible. Data and logic are our home field. Use public and primary sources whenever possible. Standardize definitions and timestamps. State assumptions. Make every chart and result rerunnable with data and code.

- Long-term value first. Day jobs take most of our time. That is a constraint and an edge. Less screen time, yet no institutional deadline pressure. Subtract rather than add. Commit to a 1–3 year frame and ignore short-term noise. Focus on cash flows, capital efficiency, and moats. Precompute decisions with scenario × probability × impact so time and compounding do the work.

On this basis I built Investing 101 for Tech Professionals. I am organizing to keep learning and sharing a reproducible, actionable workflow that helps more tech professionals build an approach that fits them.
